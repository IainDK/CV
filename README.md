## Iain Kinnish

I'm a Junior Full-Stack Developer who previously worked as an Insurance Broker. I recently graduated from Makers Academy, where I learned how to write clean, test-driven code that follows SOLID principles.

Now seeking employment, I'm looking for a role in an agile environment that will allow me to further develop the skills I acquired while studying at Makers. I consider myself to be tech agnostic; capable of picking up new languages in a short period of time. As such, I would be happy in a role that either takes advantage of the languages I am already comfortable with - i.e. Ruby and JavaScript - or grants me the opportunity to learn a brand new language and stack.
